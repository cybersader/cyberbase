# Using Local Models with Ollama

## Context Window Limits

- Huge issue if you hit the context window limit
	- [BUG: Ollama Requests seem to be missing page context? · Issue #248 · obsidianmd/obsidian-clipper](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-clipper/issues/248#issuecomment-2533544643)
	- You can add `|slice:0,1000` (replace 1000 with whatever estimate you have for limiting the context to make it work)

## Using Ollama

- Go onto the [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) website to find resources and the models that they support

# Using CSS Selectors
